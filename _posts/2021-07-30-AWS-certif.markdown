I got certified a few weeks ago, my first certification with AWS. 

I wanted to go on a long rant but honestly, this can be boring to read. 
I will go for a merry Q&A with myself and I, hopefully funny to read.

Let's start.

**Q**: Why did you go on a certification?  
**A**: Too much time to spend?  
Nah, kidding. I was considering about it for some time,
to go for a challenge and learning new things.

**Q**: Which certification did you aim?  
**A**: I aimed for the cloud practioner certification, [that one](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/)

**Q**: Did you learn old things?  
**A**: Absolutely.  
As you may know, you go back to the fundamentals about networking like  
there is 
no NAAS (Network As A Service) or that the application loadbalancer (ALB) is different from a classical 
network loadbalancer or what is transactional database  
and how different it is from a NoSQL db and many fundamentals as such

**Q**: Did you learn new things, too?  
**A**: Lol.  
Absolutely too (big grin).The [serverless architecture](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/serverless/), which services are serverless and which are not. How the pricing is done by AWS and also things like the [well architected framework](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/blogs/apn/the-5-pillars-of-the-aws-well-architected-framework/) and its 5 pillars. The different kind of storages like [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (Simple Storage Service) or what is an [EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/) (Elastic Cloud Computing).
I won't be able to sum-up everything here as the range of AWS services is substantial, one of the benefits of the certification is that it gives you a detailed sum-up of all the AWS services.

**Q**: Talking about benefits, what are the benefits you did see from achieving that certification?  
**A**: Many.  
First is it gives you a full spectrum of many services provided by AWS. Another benefit is 
that the certification gives you confidence on your knowledge of the AWS galaxy. 
I give you that one: I will not use RDS (Ed: database) if someone tells me he would need a load-balancer (Ed: Luckily you won't do that. Lol).

**Q**: Does it take time to prepare?  
**A**: Yeah. As it was my first certification with AWS and I did have much much background with AWS certification, 
it was quite unsettling for me. Therefore, I took 13 mock tests to be sure I had the correct level.
[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new/)'s said you need around 90% success to go for it. Luckily, I had some spare time but if 
I did not, I would still try to go for a least one mock exam, a day.

**Q**: So did you pass the exam? You said yes but what was the score?  
**A**: Yeah!  
I passed (Victory sign)! The minimum score is 70% to pass. I had around 80%, which is definitely good 
but a bit less than what I was expecting (Ed: He was expecting 90%)

**Q**: Thank you all your answers. Do you have any tricks you can share with us?  
**A**: Practice. A lot. The exam is not tough but not an easy one. The questions can be tricky. 13 mocks can seem a lot. If you don't want to go for that many tests, still make sure that you have a higher success in your mock tests than the expected 70%, 80%-90% gives you confidence that you are ready.
And obviously, on d-day, stress will make your score lower than expected.
For the cloud practioner, AWS through the aws training [website](https://www.aws.training/), offers you 
a AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials course that is a day format with real trainers.  
That training is free.I had two trainers, ---- and [Tom of AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/partners/training/) who were absolutely amazing, in their enthusiasm and their amazing teaching skills.  
Thank you ---- and Tom.

**Q**: Thank you again for your time. Do you have any last trick you want to share with us about 
some not tidy desk?  
**A**: Ha ha. I went for my certificate with a quite cluttered desk. Never, ever. Make sure that your desk is clean and uncluttered otherwise the proctor won't start the exam.

**Ed**: Thank you  
**Me**: Welcome!
