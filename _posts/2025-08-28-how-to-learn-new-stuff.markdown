When time feels scarce, learning new things are not a priority. 
Yet, in an ever exponentialy changing world, the need to stay curious is real and learning new things help us to stay relevant.

One of the things I need are source of informations that are quite short (e.g 5mn to 15mn to read).
Newsletters are an easiest entry point regarding who write them. 
One of my favourite NL is [**Bitecode**](https://www.bitecode.dev/) its practical insights focusing on Python, his/her insight of the dev job and last but not least, new tools. 
Another one I enjoy very much is [**Cassidy’s newsletter**](https://cassidoo.co/newsletter/) for its mix of tech and humor. They land in my inbox, bite-sized, intesting, sometime not but always mind challenging.
Another one is [**TLDR**](https://tldr.tech/newsletters), 5 minutes for everything you need to know  

I'm also following blog, the first one is [**Stéphane Robert’s blog**](https://blog.stephane-robert.info/post/), it talks about devops. 

It depends also on my workload but going after a certification is a way to be in touch with the market, the new trend of the workplace. I became certified as a [**SAFe Agilist**](https://scaledagile.com/certification/safe-agilist/), agile at scale last july.  

Learning doesn't often needs a lot of time, a few dozen of minutes daily. Slowly but certainly, these precious minutes add up and keep the curiosity alive. 

“A curious mind is like a flower that needs daily drops of wonder to flourish.”
