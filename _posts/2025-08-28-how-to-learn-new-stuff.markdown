When time feels scarce, learning new things is not a priority.  

Yet, in an exponentially changing world, the need to stay curious is real — and learning new things helps us stay relevant.

One of the things I look for are sources of information that are short (e.g., 5 to 15 minutes to read).  

Newsletters are the easiest entry point, depending on who writes them.  

- One of my favourites is [**Bitecode**](https://www.bitecode.dev/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, with practical insights on Python, perspectives on the dev job, and — last but not least — new tools.  
- I also enjoy [**Cassidy’s newsletter**](https://cassidoo.co/newsletter/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} for its mix of tech and humor. They land in my inbox bite-sized — interesting, sometimes not, but always thought-provoking.  
- Another one is [**TLDR**](https://tldr.tech/newsletters){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, 5 minutes for everything you need to know.

I’m also following blogs. One I like is [**Stéphane Robert’s blog**](https://blog.stephane-robert.info/post/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, which focuses on DevOps.

Depending on my workload, I also pursue certifications as a way to stay in touch with the market and workplace trends. Last July, I became certified as a [**SAFe Agilist**](https://scaledagile.com/certification/safe-agilist/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (Agile at Scale).

Learning doesn’t always need a lot of time — just a few dozen minutes daily. Slowly but surely, these precious minutes add up and keep curiosity alive.
