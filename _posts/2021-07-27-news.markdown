It's been a year since my last post on my blog.

Time has been flying but it has been a ride, so far!

I want to talk about things that i've been doing this year, to name a few, 
learning, teaching, building and [passing exam](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/).

Not sure how I will talk about these subjects but I will be more often on this blog 
as I have things to share with you. Technically, not doubt but also on a personnal perspective, how I've learnt or I taught these subjects.

Welcome back to my blog.
